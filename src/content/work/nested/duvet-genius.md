I've created a basic web page that generates passwords using JavaScript and Tailwind CSS.
With this website, users can easily generate secure passwords with just a few clicks. 
JavaScript handles the password generation logic, ensuring that the passwords generated are strong and reliable. 
Tailwind CSS provides the styling for the website, giving it a clean and modern look. 
This project demonstrates how simple it is to create useful web applications using popular front-end technologies like JavaScript and Tailwind CSS.
